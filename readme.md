# Introduction
This is a senior thesis project. The core idea is to automatically create a data pipeline using LLM.

# Details

- The usage of meta data become a common step to create a data pipeline, since it allow's a better 
understading of the data being transform and also acts as a documentation for future reference.

- This project introduces the metadata as a main character that will produces most or even all the 
pipeline required python code.

# Restrictions 

- Project archtecure (software engineering) is *NOT* the in the scope.
- For each source metadata provided a single python file will be exported.
- The output doesn't *handled connection's* (credantials) or path to the source.


# Objectives
1. Explorer the usage of self-planning in LLM.
2. Define the "roles" that will be played.
3. Write each role prompt following the chain-of-thought process.
